# Data_Incubator_2020 Project Proposal and Data Source
This is my project proposal for Data Incubator:
The explosion of COVID 19 brings an expected but big and deep on our daily life and global economy. Therefore, personally I am interested in analyzing this more detailedly - how COVID 19 is going and how it is and will affect our daily life and economy, which may include education, employment, stock, real estate, and so on. As I could not find more data so far, this is just a warmup. Researching COVID 19 will be a big but very critical topic.

In order to figure out the situation of COVID 19 now and how it would affect our daily life, I would do this analysis through the datasets: Employment rate from OECD data and owid-covid-data from the GitHub of Our World in Data. It is a dataset consist of all the latest data, for example the cases of Covid 19 globally and employment rate globally.

At this first stage, I will start to analyze 3 points: How the cases(total and death) is going each day? How COVID-19 is related to gender and smokers? How it will affect global economy, from the employment rate first?
